This is Erlang NIF binding to the libuuid C library.
The libuuid C library was written by Theodore Y. Ts'o for the ext2 filesystem utilties
(available from http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/).

Run 'make' to build the binding, 'make test' to run the unit tests,
and 'make doc' will generate Edoc documentation.
